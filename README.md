# Wedding Planning App

A comprehensive wedding planning application built with Next.js and Supabase.

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file with the following variables:

```bash
# Supabase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key

# OpenAI Configuration
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

## Supabase RLS Setup

Since this app uses Row Level Security (RLS), you need to set up the following policies in your Supabase dashboard:

### 1. Enable RLS on the `weddings` table:
```sql
ALTER TABLE weddings ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

### 2. Create RLS policies:

**Allow anonymous users to read wedding data:**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Allow anonymous read access" ON weddings
FOR SELECT USING (true);
```

**Allow anonymous users to insert wedding data:**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Allow anonymous insert access" ON weddings
FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (true);
```

**Allow authenticated users to update their own data:**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated update access" ON weddings
FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL);
```

### 3. Enable anonymous authentication in Supabase:
1. Go to Authentication ‚Üí Settings in your Supabase dashboard
2. Enable "Anonymous sign-ins"
3. Set the anonymous session duration as needed

## Authentication

The app uses Supabase authentication with anonymous sign-in to work with RLS. Users are automatically signed in anonymously when they visit the app, ensuring seamless access to wedding data while maintaining security through RLS policies.

## AI Features

- Visual venue recommendations with images
- Vendor suggestions with pricing

All AI features are context-aware, using your wedding details (location, theme, guest count, budget) to provide personalized recommendations.
